# NeuroHack
Welcome to NeuroHack, a Machine Learning Hackathon organized by the College of Engineering Pune (COEP). The event is open to students, researchers, and professionals interested in using Machine Learning to solve real-world problems.

## Problem Statement
The challenge for this hackathon is to develop a Machine Learning model that can accurately translate English sentences into Hinglish. The dataset provided for training and validation includes English, Hindi, and Hinglish sentences. The test dataset includes only English and Hindi sentences.

## Approach
We used the Neural Machine Translation using Transformers approach to solve this problem. The model was trained using the TensorFlow framework.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and validation includes English, Hindi, and Hinglish sentences. The test dataset includes only English and Hindi sentences.

## Requirements
To run the code, the following libraries are required:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- pandas

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run the colab `Languag_Translation_Transformer`

## Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the test dataset using the BLEU score metric.
