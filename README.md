# NeuroHack
Welcome to NeuroHack, a Machine Learning Hackathon organized by the College of Engineering Pune (COEP). The event is open to students interested in using Machine Learning to solve real-world problems.

## Problem Statement
The challenge for this hackathon is to develop a Machine Learning model that can accurately translate English sentences into Hinglish. The dataset provided for training and validation includes English, Hindi, and Hinglish sentences. The test dataset includes only English and Hindi sentences.

## Approach
We used Neural Machine Translation using Transformers approach to solve this problem. As there is a lot of similarities in hindi and Hinglish sentence formation, we convert the input english sentence into hindi & then input it to the model which generates a Hinglish sentence.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and validation includes English, Hindi, and Hinglish sentences. The test dataset includes only English and Hindi sentences.
